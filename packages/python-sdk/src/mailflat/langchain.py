"""MailFlat LangChain integration — `MailFlatToolkit` plus a 12-tool LangChain tool set.

A thin LangChain shell over the `mailflat` SDK; all HTTP and behaviour live in the client.
`langchain-core` is an optional dependency → `pip install mailflat[langchain]`.

Usage:
    from mailflat.langchain import MailFlatToolkit
    toolkit = MailFlatToolkit(api_key=env("MAILFLAT_KEY"))
    tools = toolkit.get_tools()   # create_inbox, list_inboxes, read_messages, wait_for_otp,
                                  # wait_for_message, send_email, reply, wait_until_sent,
                                  # mark_read, burn_inbox, delete_inbox, delete_message

⚠️ Tool output goes through `redact_secrets()`: a per-inbox `api_key` must never reach the
model's context (and from there LangSmith traces) — see B-055.

⚠️ `send_email` / `reply` take `cc` and `bcc` but NOT attachments. An address is a short
string; file bytes would have to travel through the model's context, which costs tokens
and is simply impossible for a multi-megabyte file. Attach files from the SDK
(`inbox.send(..., attachments=[...])`) — the code surface, not the model surface.

⚠️ `send_email` returns "accepted", not "delivered" — delivery happens on a queue. That is
what `wait_until_sent` is for. Without it a model that gets no answer does the reasonable
thing and sends again, so the missing tool produced DUPLICATE mail, not silent loss.

Connected to:
  - imports from: mailflat.client (MailFlat), mailflat.redact, mailflat.agent_results,
    langchain_core.tools
  - imported by:  user code (LangChain agents)

Key exports:
  - `MailFlatToolkit(api_key=..., base_url=...)` — `.get_tools()` → list[BaseTool]
  - `AsyncMailFlatToolkit(...)` — the same tools with `coroutine=` bound (real async I/O)
