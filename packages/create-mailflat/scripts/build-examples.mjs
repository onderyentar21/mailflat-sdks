// GENERATES the contents of the `mailflat-examples` repo — never hand-written.
//
// Why generated: the example repo and the scaffolder say the same thing. Maintaining both by
// hand would invite exactly the drift we have already fixed twice: the template changes, the
// repo stays behind, nobody notices. Here the repo IS the template output — it cannot drift.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/build-examples.mjs [output-dir]      (default: ../../../mailflat-examples)
//
// Output: one directory per template + a root README + a CI workflow that runs the smoke
// tests. Creating and PUSHING the repo is not this script's job — that is an outward-facing
// action the user performs.
//
// Connected to:
//   - imports from: ../src/templates.js (tek kaynak)
//   - imported by:  — (a script run by hand)
//
// Key export: `buildExamples(outDir)` — { root, dirs[], files }
